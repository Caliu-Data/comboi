# Comboi Transformations Configuration
#
# This file defines transformations using DuckDB SQL, generated from data contracts.
# All transformations are declarative and driven by the contract definitions.
#
# Transformation Structure:
#   type: sql  - DuckDB SQL scripts generated from contracts
#
# Quality Checks:
#   - contract:contract_name  - References transformations/contracts/contract_name.yml
#
# =============================================================================
# SAMPLE TRANSFORMATION EXAMPLE
# =============================================================================
# This is a sample showing how to configure a SQL transformation with a data contract.
# The SQL transformation is automatically generated from the contract schema.
# To use this:
# 1. Create your data contract in transformations/contracts/
# 2. Generate SQL transformation from the contract using: python build.py --generate-sql
# 3. Configure below referencing the contract

silver:
  # Sample GDPR-compliant customer data transformation with contract-driven SQL
  - name: gdpr_customers
    type: sql
    inputs:
      - alias: bronze_customers
        stage: bronze
        source_path: "crm/customers.parquet"
    quality_checks:
      - contract:gdpr_customers

# Add your own transformations here following the same pattern
# The SQL transformation will be generated from the contract definition
